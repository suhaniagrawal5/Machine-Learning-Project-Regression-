This is a machine learning project based on regression that helps us predict home prices on the basis of area, location, total rooms and baths in bangalore region.
It includes Data Cleaning, One Hot Encoding, Feature Engineering, Outlier detection, Machine Learning ,HTMl, CSS, Javacript and lots of learning for me as an aspiring Data Scientist.
