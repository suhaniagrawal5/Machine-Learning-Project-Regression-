# Machine-Learning-Project-Regression-
Bangalore House Price Prediction (Machine Learning – Regression)
📌 Project Overview:

This is a machine learning regression project that predicts house prices in the Bangalore region based on key features such as:

Area (square feet)

Location

Number of rooms (BHK)

Number of bathrooms

The project simulates a real-world ML workflow, starting from raw data to a deployed prediction interface. It provided me with hands-on exposure to data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and frontend integration.

🎯 Problem Statement:

Real estate prices vary significantly depending on location and property characteristics.
The objective of this project is to:

Analyze housing data from Bangalore

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Train a regression model to predict house prices accurately

Build a simple web interface for making predictions
