# Machine-Learning-Project-Regression-
Bangalore House Price Prediction (Machine Learning – Regression)

📌 Project Overview:

This is a machine learning regression project that predicts house prices in the Bangalore region based on key features such as:
Area (square feet)
Location
Number of rooms (BHK)
Number of bathrooms

The project simulates a real-world ML workflow, starting from raw data to a deployed prediction interface. It provided me with hands-on exposure to data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and frontend integration.

🎯 Problem Statement:
Real estate prices vary significantly depending on location and property characteristics.

The objective of this project is to:
Analyze housing data from Bangalore
Clean and preprocess the dataset
Train a regression model to predict house prices accurately
Build a simple web interface for making predictions

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools:

Improved model stability and accuracy

Model Building:
Trained regression models
Evaluated performance using appropriate metrics
Selected the best-performing model
Frontend Integration
Created a user-friendly UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Enabled real-time price prediction

📈 Model Output:
Predicts house price based on user inputs.
Provides realistic and consistent predictions for Bangalore properties

📊 Key Learnings:

Through this project, I learned:
How real-world datasets differ from clean academic datasets
Importance of data cleaning and outlier handling
How feature engineering impacts model performance
End-to-end ML project structure
How ML models can be integrated with a frontend interface
This project significantly strengthened my understanding of applied machine learning and gave me confidence to work on more complex ML problems.


I would like to sincerely thank Codebasics for their excellent machine learning content and guidance. Their tutorials helped me understand how real-world ML projects are structured, implemented, and deployed, and played a major role in building this proje
